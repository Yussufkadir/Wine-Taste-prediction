I am doing an internet tutorial for predicting wine quality. Huge thanks for Ashwin Hariharan for the tutorial.
Huge thanks for UC Irvine for the wine dataset.
I have learned how to analyze data how to spot outliers and how to train and see the performance of multiple models at once
,and to choose the best one among them.
I have implemented a regression model for the red wine prediction and classifier and regression model for the white wine dataset.

Here are the links for the tutorial, outlier detection technique and the dataset:
